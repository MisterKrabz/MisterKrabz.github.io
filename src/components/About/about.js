            <p>
                I am a college student at the university of Wisconsin-Madison, studing 
                Computer Science and Data Science. I have had an appreciation for the 
                applications of technology every since I moved from rural Oklahoma to 
                St. Louis Missouri in middle school. 
                <br/><br/>
                I enjoy swimming in my free time and have been a competitive swimmer 
                throughout high school. During the 2023 Missouri State Swim Meet, I ranked: 
                <ul>
                    <li>7st in the 200 Freestyle relay</li>
                    <li>21nd in the 100 Breaststroke</li>
                    <li>33rd in the 100 Freestyle</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
